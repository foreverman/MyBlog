It can not be true when the total time of running the following test is 2678400.02 seconds:
    :::ruby
    it "should mess up running time without return" do
      true.should be_true
      Timecop.travel 31.days.since
    end

It turns out that we should call 'Timecop.return' after running the test so Timecop won't cheat rSpec of calculating correct running time. We can add an "after(:each)" callback into 'spec_helper'(in case we forget to return):
    :::ruby
    config.after(:each) do
      Timecop.return
    end        

An alternative is using 'Timecop.freeze' instead of 'Timecop.travel':
    :::ruby
    it "should not mess up running time without return" do
      Timecop.freeze 31.days.since do
        #do something
      end
      true.should be_true
    end
