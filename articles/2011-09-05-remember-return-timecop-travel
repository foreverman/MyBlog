It can not be true when the total time of running the following test is 2678400.02 seconds:
  it "should mess up running time without return" do
    true.should be_true
    Timecop.travel 31.days.since
  end

It turns out that we should call 'Timecop.return' after running the test so Timecop won't cheat rSpec of calculating correct running time. We can add an "after(:each)" callback into 'spec_helper'(in case we forget to return):
  config.after(:each) do
    Timecop.return
  end        

An alternative is using 'Timecop.freeze' instead of 'Timecop.travel':
  it "should not mess up running time without return" do
    Timecop.freeze 31.days.since do
      #do something
    end
    true.should be_true
  end
